		<p style= "text-align: center"> <b> These are the strenghts I have been working on over the past years. They are common skills that are suggested to be ideal traits in the working environment.<br>
			<i> Patience</i> is one such strenght that is truly required to be able to work with colleagues and associates to carry out operations that may be tedious and time-consuming. <br>
				Being <i> creative </i> as well as <i> organized </i> are outstanding qualities to possess. Many individuals like the 'out of the box' approach, hence they may ask for 
				creative outlook on projects and other items being worked on. It is good to have a unique twist to show that a particular goods or service was carfted by a specific person. <br>
				There is no set way to solve any problems; there can be many solutions. <i> Problem Solving </i> is also a very important tool in my arsenal. This can allow me to assess situations
				and challenges in a different view point and provide solutions that work effectively and efficiently.<br> During these years I have been developing these strengths and a few others. 
				However, working on assignments that are group-based has taught me to be more patient amd lenient as I have to work together and learn with each other as we go along. <br> 
				With the indiviuals assignments it helped to become more creative and assisted my problem solving skills; by allowing me to think of unique ways to present my work as well as solving it. <br>
				I consider these my strengths as I am gradually building on them and trying to implement them in my everyday life. </b></p>

		<p style="text-align: center"> <b> According to 16 Personalities, my personality traits are INFJ-T which means:<i> Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Judging and Turbulent. </i><br>
			These are traits of an Adovocate; this is someone who tends to approach life with deep thoughtfulness and imagination, they have a sense of idealism and morality. <br>
			These individuals are capable of taking concrete steps to realize their goals and make lasting positive impacts. People with this personality type tend to help others as their purpose in life. <br>
			Advocates will act with creativity, imagination, conviction, and sensitivity not to create an advantage, but to create balance. <br>
			I believe these traits truly match my personality; in the way I interact with the environment is quite introverted, even though I am easy-going. I tend to stay further from large gatherings <br>
			however, I still socialize with others and have small converstions. I slightly agree with the next trait that I am a bit intuitive more than observant, I tend to use instincts quite often. <br>
			Feelings was the next trait; advocates use their feelings to help create and strenghten their goals, I would believe that I am more emotionally driven as I use my feelings to help make certain decisions. <br>
			My tatics towards work and planning was stated to be judging; I agree with this trait as I have certain preferences in how I would like my work to be done and presented. <br>
			Lastly, I am quite conscious about my abilities and how others percieves me; thererfore I am said to have a turbulent personality. This test was quite accurate and also showed me flaws that I can try to
			change or fix if it is not suitable for work ethics. </b> </p> <br/>
